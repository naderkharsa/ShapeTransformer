# ShapeTransformer

**ShapeTransformer** is a simple Qt application that allows users to draw and transform shapes like circles and rectangles on a canvas. 

## Features
- Draw circles and rectangles on the canvas
- Scale shapes dynamically using a slider
- Rotate shapes by 15 degrees per click using the "Transform" button
- Highlight selected shapes with a thick yellow border
- Place a green dot to indicate the next position for shape placement
- Only one placement indicator (green dot) is allowed at a time
- Select and transform existing shapes by clicking on them

## How to Use
1. Select a shape from the toolbar (Circle or Rectangle).
2. Click on the canvas to place the shape.
3. Use the scale slider to resize the shape.
4. Press the transform button to rotate the selected shape.
5. Use the green dot as a position marker for placing shapes.
6. Only one green dot is allowed at a time; previous dots are removed automatically.
